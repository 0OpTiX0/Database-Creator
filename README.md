This program will soon be able to create databases of a user determined type. It uses the Double hashing method to store data in an unordered set and has a time complexity of O(n) (at least im pretty sure it does :/ ). Looking to lower the time complexity to O(log N) 
so that it can take in large quantitites of data for whatever reason.
